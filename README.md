# wavenote

So basically it's a tool that helps you make notes on audio track.
There's a stupid song I took as an audio from a festival record, just change it with stuff you want.

With wavenote you can:
- Listen to an audio file!
- Make timestamped notes. To create note just click on the track, write some text and hit 'Make note'
- Create areas that reffer to a segment of an audio and attach some text to them. There is a space between the ruler and the track. You can create an area by clicking+draggin there.
- Save your notes as .json.
- Load your notes.json

Scale track with moving your mouse holding 'shift' + LMB on the ruler.
To delete a note or an area - click on it, then click 'Remove note'

It's currently in progress. I'm still learning and haven't done anything to make it look better.
