# wavenote

So basically it's a tool that helps you make notes on audio track.
There's a stupid song I took as an audio from a festival record, just change it with stuff you want.

With wavenote you can:
- Listen to an audio file!
- Make timestamped notes. There are two inputs, they are supposed to be Text and Signature, I've not labeled them these inputs. To create note just click on the track, write some text and hit 'Make note'
- Create areas that refferes to a segment of an audio and attach some text to them, as for notes but without signature. There is a space between the ruler and the track. You can create an area by clicking+dragginf there.
- Save your notes as .json.
- Load your notes.json

Scale track with moving your mouse holding 'shift' + LMB on the ruler.
To delete a note or an area - click on it, then click 'Remove note'

It's currently in progress. I'm still learning and haven't done anything to make it look better.
